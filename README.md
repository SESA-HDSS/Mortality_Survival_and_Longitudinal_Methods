# Mortality Survival and Longitudinal Methods
## Workshop overview
This workshop is part of the Strengthening Ethiopian Surveys and Analytics (SESA) project, which aims to strengthen the generation of policy-relevant evidence in reproductive, maternal, neonatal, child, and adolescent health and nutrition (RMNCAH+N). The National Data Management Centre (NDMC) at the Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI), in collaboration with the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), works to enhance the capacity of Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems (HDSS) in Ethiopia to conduct longitudinal data analyses.
“R” has become the standard open-source platform for advanced statistical analysis of complex, large-scale data. Building on the introductory R and RStudio course, this workshop focuses on longitudinal data analysis, which is central to HDSS. Longitudinal datasets present both opportunities (temporal information, repeated measures) and challenges (missing data, clustering, time-varying covariates). In this course, we extend participants’ skills in R and RStudio to manage, model, and interpret longitudinal HDSS data, with a focus on practical application and reproducible workflows. 
## Aim of the Workshop
The workshop aims to strengthen the capacity of HDSS research teams in advanced R-based techniques for analysing longitudinal data. The course will emphasise both the technical skills required to conduct analyses and the conceptual understanding needed to interpret results in applied HDSS contexts.
## Content
The workshop will be delivered through a mix of short lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on practical sessions in RStudio. Each topic will begin with a conceptual overview, followed by guided coding exercises using HDSS mock or other datasets. Group discussions and collaborative tasks will encourage peer learning and allow participants to connect methods to their own HDSS experiences, ensuring the training is both applied and directly relevant.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:
* Calculate mortality rates based on person-years and interpret measures for comparison across time period
* Apply survival analysis methods to estimate and interpret time-to-event outcomes
* Fit and interpret mixed-effects and multilevel models for repeated measures data
* Analyse time series of HDSS indicators, identify trends and seasonal variation, and apply basic forecasting methods
* Properly document analytical approaches and ensure reproducibility using R tools
* Critically assess scientific publications reporting longitudinal studies utilising HDSS data
